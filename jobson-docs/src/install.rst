Install
=======

# Install

- Ensure you have `java` 8 on your platform (e.g. `sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre`)
- Find an appropriate [release](https://github.com/adamkewley/jobson/releases) for your platform
- Install it, if it's pre-packed for your platform (e.g. `.deb` on ubuntu). Otherwise, manually
  install it (below)

### Manual Install

- Download a binary tarball for your platform (e.g. `*nix`) from the
  [releases](https://github.com/adamkewley/jobson/releases) page (e.g. `jobson-nix-0.0.15.tar.gz`)
- Unzip the tarball wherever you want jobson to be installed (e.g. `/opt`)
- (optional) Add the top-level `jobson` executable to the PATH (e.g. `ln -s jobson /usr/local/bin/jobson`)
