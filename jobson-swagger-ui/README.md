# jobson-swagger-ui

Static web documentation for Jobson's HTTP API.

This project takes the `swagger.json` generated by the `jobson-swagger` module and
wraps [swagger-ui-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-dist) around it,
which produces a tarball containing static web assets for viewing Jobson's API
documentation.
